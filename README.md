❓ Ask your agronomy question: Give NDVI for region [[74.0,31.5],[74.1,31.5],[74.1,31.6],[74.0,31.6]] between 2025-01-01 and 2025-01-31

💬 Thinking...

📊 Mean NDVI for 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-31: 0.672

###❓ Example Research Questions

Here are some sample queries you can try:

🌾 "Give NDVI for region [[74.0,31.5],[74.1,31.5],[74.1,31.6],[74.0,31.6]] between 2025-01-01 and 2025-01-31"
🧪 "How can I improve soil fertility in sandy soil?"
📈 "What is the expected yield of wheat in Punjab this season?"
💧 "How much irrigation is recommended for rice at the tillering stage?"
💹 "What are the current market prices of basmati rice in Pakistan?"

### 👨‍💻 What Each Agent Does

BaseAgent (AgroDeepSearchAgent)

#### General agronomy assistant
Handles broad research and supports other agents

#### SoilExpert
Focuses on soil fertility, pH, nutrient management, and soil amendments

#### CropExpert
Specializes in yield prediction, crop rotation, NDVI analysis, and health monitoring

#### AgriEconomist
Advises on agricultural economics, profitability, and market analysis

#### Escalation Agent
Detects urgent crop/pest/disease problems
Suggests immediate remedies
Asks if you want to escalate to a professional agronomist

## 🤝 How the Team Coordinates

#### Router Step
Each question is analyzed by a routing model that decides which experts should respond.

#### Expert Responses
The selected agents (SoilExpert, CropExpert, AgriEconomist, etc.) independently generate answers.

#### Synthesis
The system merges multiple expert responses into one clear, non-repetitive answer.

#### Escalation Path
If the query is urgent (pest outbreak, crop disease, etc.), the Escalation Agent is triggered.
You receive quick immediate actions + option to escalate to a professional agronomist.
